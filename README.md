This code creates a responsive website introducing the Magic the Gathering Deck Builder API. The following components form the website's structure:

- **Header**: Holds the primary heading and a paragraph that introduces the website and gives some information about the API.
- **Main Section**: Encompasses the "API Documentation" and "Deck Testing" sections. Each section contains details and links that users can follow to explore the API documentation and test their decks, respectively.
- **Footer**: Contains the "Contact Us" section, offering users a channel to reach out with their questions or feedback.

**Customization and Enhancement**:

You can enhance the website by incorporating the following elements:

1. **Styling**: Add a CSS stylesheet to style the website, creating a visually appealing interface. The link to the stylesheet can be added where the placeholder is indicated in the `<head>` section.
2. **JavaScript**: Introduce JavaScript or other programming languages to add functionality to the website, such as interactive features or dynamic content updates. Include your JavaScript file at the placeholder in the `<head>` section.
3. **Additional Elements**: Incorporate other HTML elements like forms, tables, or images to provide more information or functionalities to your users.
   
By expanding upon this basic structure, you can create a rich, interactive platform for MTG enthusiasts to explore and utilize your Deck Builder API.
