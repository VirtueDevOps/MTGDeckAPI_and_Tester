# MTGDeckAPI_and_Tester

This code creates a website with a heading, a paragraph, and a few links. The heading and paragraph introduce the website and provide some basic information about the API. The "Deck Testing" section includes a list of three links that allow players to test their decks in different ways. The "Contact Us" section includes a link that allows users to contact the website owner for more information.

You can customize this code to suit your needs by adding additional elements, such as forms, tables, or images, and by styling the website using CSS. You can also add functionality to the website by using JavaScript or other programming languages.
